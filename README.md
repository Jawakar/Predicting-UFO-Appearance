A Flask based web app, deployed using Heroku that predicts the location of Unidentified Flying Object based on seconds, latitude and longitude.
</br>
</br>
I have used Flask to build my web app. It is a microframework for Python which works based on webserver gateway interface (WSGI) and Jinja 2 template engine. 
</br>
</br>
I deployed using Heroku. It's a PaaS that is used to deploy web apps. While deploying I faced many errors and solved going through the logs.
